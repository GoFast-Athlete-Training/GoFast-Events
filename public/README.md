# Public Folder

This folder contains static assets that are served at the root path.

## Files

- `bgr-logo.png` - BGR logo for favicon (add this file)
- Add any other static assets here (images, fonts, etc.)

## Usage

Files in this folder can be referenced with absolute paths starting with `/`:
- `/bgr-logo.png` - BGR logo
- `/favicon.ico` - Favicon (if needed)

## Note

In Vite, files in the `public` folder are copied to the `dist` folder during build and served at the root path.
